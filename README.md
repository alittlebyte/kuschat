### Description
Small chat built upon an existing websocket. <br/>
Receives data in {'text':...} objects, sends back {'created':... ,'name':... ,'text':...} ones <br/>
Decided not to use vue-router to separate login system, since it's much easier to pass the props around inside a single component - but it's doable.<br/>
Nothing impressive, just polished. Also, this taught me more about the way Websockets work.
